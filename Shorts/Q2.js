// Dependencies vs devDependencies in package.json

/*
  Dependencies => those are required for the code in Run time (react,axios)
  devDependencies => those are required for development mode(enzyme,jest,esLint)
*/


/*
  so at the time of depoly our prject we always be careful that where the package should come under dependencies or devdependencies
*/

// npm i => dependencies
// npm i --save => dependencies
// npm i --save-dev => devdependencies;
